# The Tale Jade Template Engine

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Talesoft/tale-jade.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Talesoft/tale-jade)


> **Finally a fully-functional, complete and clean port of the Jade language to PHP**
>
> *â€” Abraham Lincoln*


The Tale Jade Template Engine brings the popular and powerful Templating-Language [Jade for Node.js](http://jade-lang.com) to PHP!

While previously there only existed ports of the existing Node.js Engine of Jade, **Tale Jade** is a completely new
implementation of the language utilizing the powerful and very specific features of PHP in your Jade application.

Build dynamic websites faster than ever before!

***Notice: Sorry that most documents are down right now, we're still working on them.***
***Our engine is really new and we're still documenting all functions of our***
***insane development process. Below you have a quick-guide to get up and running without the docs right now***

Initial API docs online now: [API Docs](http://jade.talesoft.io/docs)

## Getting Started

The composer package for Tale Jade is called [`talesoft/tale-jade`](https://packagist.org/packages/talesoft/tale-jade)

If you want to get started right now, hook up [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and run

```
$ composer require talesoft/tale-jade:*
$ composer install
```

After that put the following line in your `index.php` (or anywhere you like)

```php

include 'vendor/autoload.php';

$renderer = new Tale\Jade\Renderer();

echo $renderer->render('your-jade-file');
```

This way, the renderer will search for `your-jade-file.jade` in your `PATH`-environment-variable.
Notice that the path passed to `render` needs to be relative, *always*.
To add alternative paths, scroll down a bit.

This uses the `stream` Renderer-adapter which doesn't work if you don't have `allow_url_fopen` enabled.
In this case, switch to the `file`-adapter

```php

$renderer = new Tale\Jade\Renderer([
    'adapter' => 'file'
]);
```

This will automatically create a `./cache`-directory in your document root.

To change this directory, use the `path`-option in the `adapterOptions`

```php

$renderer = new Tale\Jade\Renderer([
    'adapter' => 'file',
    'adapterOptions' => [
        'path' => '/your/absolute/cache/path'
    ]
]);
```


This will cache generated jade-files for 3600 seconds (1 hour) and render them through a file.
You can always watch the PHTML-output in the `cache`-directory this way.

To disable the caching (It will still generate the files, but it will generate them on each page call),
use the `lifeTime`-option of the `file`-adapter. Set it to `0` to disable the cache completely

```php

$renderer = new Tale\Jade\Renderer([
    'adapter' => 'file',
    'adapterOptions' => [
        'path' => '/your/absolute/cache/path',
        'lifeTime' => 0
    ]
]);
```


To enable formatting of the PHTML-output, use the `pretty`-option of the compiler

```php

$renderer = new Tale\Jade\Renderer([
    'compiler' => [
        'pretty' => false
    ]
]);
```

To use an own `views` or `templates` directory instead of the `PATH`-variable you can add paths to the compiler

```php

//Either with
$renderer = new Tale\Jade\Renderer([
    'compiler' => [
        'paths' => [__DIR__.'/views']
    ]
]);

//or with
$renderer->getCompiler()->addPath(__DIR__.'/views');
```

As soon as you pass *any* path, the loading from the `PATH`-environment-variable will be disabled and you
always load from your passed directory/ies

To pass variables to your Jade-file, use the second argument of the `render`-method

```php

echo $renderer->render('index', [
    'title' => 'Jade is awesome!',
    'content' => 'Oh yeah, it is.'
]);
```

These can be used inside the templates in several ways (Stick to the Jade-syntax, it works)

- Huge amount of (optional) configuration possibilities
- Graceful compiler forgiving many mistakes (e.g. spaces around the code)
- Lightning fast and clean compilation
- Detailed error handling

- Intelligent expression parsing



## Getting started

To install and use the Tale Jade library, follow our [Getting Started](http://jade.talesoft.io/getting-started) guide.

If you're interested, you might also look into our in-depth guides:

- [In-depth configuration](http://jade.talesoft.io/configuration)
- [Hacking Tale Jade](http://jade.talesoft.io/hacking)



## There's more to come...

Tale Jade is actively used and developed in many projects and is improved constantly.

We don't stick to the Jade-convention, but we'll always provide compatibility to Node.js Jade to
help reducing confusion.

We love Jade, we love PHP, we love Node.js and we love the official and original Jade-contributors.
We just don't love the way people implement existing stuff in PHP :)

Planned features:
- [ ] Import Attributes (`include some-file(some-var='some-value')`)
- [ ] Helper Libraries
- [ ] Aliases (Like mixins, just smaller)
