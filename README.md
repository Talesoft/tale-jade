The Tale Jade Template Engine brings the popular and powerful Templating-Language [Jade for Node.js](http://jade-lang.com) to PHP!

Tale Jade is the first complete and most powerful Jade implementation in PHP.

## Getting Started


### Install with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)

[Download Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

The composer package for Tale Jade is called [`talesoft/tale-jade`](https://packagist.org/packages/talesoft/tale-jade)

If you want to get started right now, hook up [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and run

```bash
$ composer require "talesoft/tale-jade:*"
$ composer install
```

or add it to your `composer.json` by yourself

```json
{
    "require": {
        "talesoft/tale-jade": "*"
    }
}
```

### Install by downloading the sources

You can also download the sources by yourself.

Tale Jade is compatible with the [PSR-0](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/) and [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) autoloading standards.

Put the sources inside your a `Tale/Jade` subfolder inside your autoloading directories, e.g. `library/Tale/Jade` and you're ready to go!

The easiest way might be to just put a clone of the repository there, that way you can update it easier

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Talesoft/tale-jade.git library/Tale/Jade
```

or as a sub-module if you're using git for your project as well

```bash
$ git submodule add git@github.com:Talesoft/tale-jade.git library/Tale/Jade
```


### Rendering a Jade Template

Include the `vendor/autoload.php` file of composer in your PHP script and get started with Tale Jade!

```php

use Tale\Jade;

//Include the vendor/autoload.php if you're using composer!
include('vendor/autoload.php');

$renderer = new Jade\Renderer();

echo $renderer->render('your-jade-file');
```

This way, the renderer will search for `your-jade-file.jade` in your `get_include_path()`-paths.
Notice that the path passed to `render` should be relative. You can give it absolute paths, but it will make caching harder.

We show you how to add alternative search paths further in the **Basic configuration** section below.

When the Jade-file gets rendered, a `./cache/views`-directory is created automatically and the compiled PHTML will be stored in that directory.

To change this directory, use the `cachePath`-option

```php

$renderer = new Jade\Renderer([
    'cache_path' => '/your/absolute/cache/path'
]);
```


The Jade-file will now be rendered to that directory on each call.

To enable a cache that won't render the files on each call, use the `lifeTime` option of the `file`-adapter


```php

$renderer = new Jade\Renderer([
    'ttl' => 3600 //Will cache the file for 3600 seconds (one hour)
]);
```


### Basic configuration


To enable formatting of the PHTML-output, use the `pretty`-option

```php

$renderer = new Jade\Renderer([
    'pretty' => true
]);
```


If you don't want to use the `get_include_path()`-paths (which could actually harbor a security risk in some cases), pass your own search paths to the Renderer.
Rendered and included Jade-files will be searched in those paths and not in the `get_include_path()`-paths anymore.

```php

//Either with
$renderer = new Jade\Renderer([
    'paths' => [__DIR__.'/views']
]);

//or with
$renderer->addPath(__DIR__.'/views');
```

As soon as you pass *any* path, the loading from the `get_include_path()`-paths will be disabled and you always load from your passed directory/ies.

To pass variables to your Jade-file, use the second argument of the `render`-method

```php

echo $renderer->render('index', [
    'title' => 'Jade is awesome!',
    'content' => 'Oh yeah, it is.'
]);
```

These can be used inside Jade as normal variables

```jade

h1= $title

+content-block($content)
```

## Supported features

We support every single feature the [original Jade implementation](http://jade-lang.com/reference/) supports!
This always has been and will always be our main target.

**But why stop there?**
PHP has it's own features that are surely different from JavaScript's.
By utilizing those features we aim to bring in more, compatible features into the language to make the fastest template development ever possible!

**You can try features and see a bunch of examples on our [sandbox site](http://sandbox.jade.talesoft.io)**

### There's more to come...

Tale Jade is actively used and developed in many projects and is improved constantly.

We don't stick to the Jade-convention, but we'll always provide compatibility to Node.js Jade to help reducing confusion.

We love Jade, we love PHP, we love Node.js and we love the official and original Jade-contributors.

**Planned features:**
- [x] Command line tools
- [ ] Import Attributes (`include some-file(some-var='some-value')`)
- [ ] Helper Libraries (Own custom helper libraries)
- [ ] Aliases (Like mixins, just smaller)
- [ ] Website Kit for easy website creation with Tale Jade
